The Gemfiles in this directory define all native extensions that Traveling Ruby supports. To add a new native extension, create a new directory and create a Gemfile inside containing the new native extension. Then run `bundle install` inside that directory on your workstation (to create/update the Gemfile.lock), and re-run the Traveling Ruby build system.
